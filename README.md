# Vision
The purpose of this application is to give the participants of the course a goal to work against. It is currently an ongoing project but more experienced students can already contribute if they like. Feature-Requests as well as bugs will be created as Github-Issues which can be worked off at any time. Each week a new version will be released and the issues related with the release tagged. Thus, different versions of the application can be used to adjust exercises to the student's needs.
